          Newspaper articles which aims to explains that a number of American weapons were lost in Afghanistan. This is significant in the long term because as long as those weapons are kept in fair condition, they can pose a threat to anyone.

          Article about guns as a symbol of dominance during the British Empire. I am looking for an article about a certain historical event which I cannot remember the name of. In short, the British overlooked that fact that natives of the colony had weapons passed down from previous generations and successfully incited a revolt against the colonists with them. This is a strong argument to use in my project and I want to try to emphasize this concept.

          This article discusses that the British aimed to take away colonists’ firearms during the American Revolution. This is an interesting point because it shows all firearms can be used which is a threat to governments.

          <br>
          This article sheds light on a recent event in New York City where supporter to defund the police used the song as a tool for unification. The article explains a brief history of the song, and ultimately explains how the message has been distorted by people who have little context about world institutions to sound like the perfect solution to any problem. This quote explains this more:
          <br>
          “Not only has the song become a go-to anthem for the detached, a song that asks that we imagine a world with no differences as opposed to challenging us to see each other fully but without hate, but it has also been distorted here for the purpose of squelching concerns about law enforcement institutions that are very likely irrevocably broken”
