        <h1>Framing Story</h1>
        <p>
          Sometime in the distant future, on Earth, the world was overwhelmed by a movement make society more perfect. The anthem of this movement was the work of songwriter John Lennon. In his song “Imagine,” Lennon makes the proposal for a radical new world, calling for the dissolving of formal nations, the removal of any motives for self-sacrifice or harm to others, a ban of possessions, greed, and hunger.
          In order to accomplish this, all lethal firearm ammunition was confiscated and replaced with floral rounds to spread peace and love.
          As time went on, complacency set in and society became very homogenized. Strong cultures throughout the world disassembled. Cultures merged with cultures and as a result local color, notable cuisines, and overseas fashion became homogenized as well.
          In order to solve the hunger issue, cafeteria-like institutions were established. These institutions served food that was easy to reproduce and therefore lacked variety. Additionally, the food was good for sustenance, but was bland and flavorless because there was not needed to advertise variety.
          However, while all seems good and well, a faction of society is opposed to the complacency and sameness and form an opposition. If this faction managed to manufacture arms and incite a revolt, who would defend the new society and how would they do it?

          The world looks very gray and dull. Art, architecture, and design is homogenized and looks the same. For example, there are many car manufacturers but only one common style of chassis; imagine every car on street was a black VW Beetle.
          The world tastes bland like bread without salt.
          Music and sound are more like noise by today’s standards.
          The world feels as exciting as chopping vegetables with a dulled knife.

          In this iteration, my concept of “chaos” from my first iteration refers to the idea that complacent life is boring, and some people feel the need to disrupt sameness and make life more interesting. The “chaos” is the diversity within society as we know it today. The “chaos” is NOT the rebellious faction taking up arms against sameness and society; this rebellion was one idea for the means by which these detractors might return the world to diversity. The “chaos” is the opposition's end goal of bringing color back into the world through diversity.
          It is important to understand that the message is conveying potentials. It is asking how the society would react if this prototype was to backfire. Therefore, violent opposition is not advocated as a solution, but, although extreme, it is just one example of bringing about change.
          In my imagined future, people have created a seemingly perfect utopia. There is no differentiation of borders, there is no greed or hunger, and motives of violence, war, and self-sacrifice have been resolved. The most important artifact from this world is a firearm that shoots flowers. Society has eliminated the manufacture of lethal ammunition, which is more the effect of violence rather than the firearm itself.

          I seek to ask two main questions with this world and object. If a rebellion was to arise against the complacency of society, how would the people of the society itself defend the society itself if they banned lethal ammunition and the opposition found a means to manufacture their own ammunition? Furthermore, should a revolt be incited, who of the society would be willing to defend it even if the proper countermeasures were supplied to them?
